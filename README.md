#### Disclaimer

This SDK is at an alpha stage where things easily can break. We aim to make our
alpha releases as stable as possible. Neverless it should not be taken as
production-ready. To catch up with the more edgy state of development please
check out the [develop branch].

[develop branch]: https://github.com/aeternity/aepp-sdk-js/tree/develop

## [Usage Documentation]

1. Add the latest `@aeternity/aepp-sdk` release from npmjs.com to your project using one of these commands

```bash
pnpm i @aeternity/aepp-sdk
# or
npm i @aeternity/aepp-sdk
# or
yarn add @aeternity/aepp-sdk
```

**Note:** To install a _Pre-Release_ (latest `beta` or `alpha` version) using on the latest Epoch version, you have to install the package appending the `@next` tag reference.
```bash
pnpm i @aeternity/aepp-sdk@next
npm i @aeternity/aepp-sdk@next
yarn add @aeternity/aepp-sdk@next
```

> Hint: You can also add a development version from GitHub by dropping the `@` and
> adding `#` and a branch name at the end, for example
> `pnpm i aeternity/aepp-sdk#develop`.

2. Import the right flavor. For this example with get the `Uninveral` flavor, which contains all the features of the SDK:

```js
const {AE} = require('@aeternity/aepp-sdk')
const {MemoryAccount} = require('@aeternity/aepp-sdk')
```

3. Create an instance and interact with it

```js

// Start the instance

Ae({
  url: 'https://sdk-testnet.aepps.com',
  internalUrl: 'https://sdk-testnet.aepps.com',
  accounts: [MemoryAccount({keypair: {secretKey: 'A_PRIV_KEY', publicKey: 'A_PUB_ADDRESS'}})],
}).then(ae => {

  // Interacting with the blockchain client

  ae.height().then(height => {
    // logs current height
    console.log('height', height)
  }).catch(e => {
    // logs error
    console.log(e)
  })

  ae.balance('A_PUB_ADDRESS').then(balance => {
    // logs current balance of "A_PUB_ADDRESS"
    console.log('balance', balance)
  }).catch(e => {
    // logs error
    console.log(e)
  })
})
