#### Disclaimer

This SDK is in continuos development where things can easily break, especially if you're not an officially released version. We aim to make all our
 releases as stable as possible, neverless it should not be taken as
production-ready.

To catch up with the more edgy state of development please
check out the [develop branch].

## Quick Start

### 1. Install the SDK
Add the latest `@aeternity/aepp-sdk` release from npmjs.com to your project using one of these commands

```bash
# install using npm...or yarn or pnpm
npm i @aeternity/aepp-sdk
```

**Note:** To install a _Pre-Release_ (latest `beta` or `alpha` version) using on the latest Node version, you have to install the package appending the `@next` tag reference, or even use the `#` symbol and the Repo URL to install a version coming from a specific branch.
```bash
# install the @next version of the SDK
npm i @aeternity/aepp-sdk@next

# install the #develop version of the SDK
npm i https://github.com/aeternity/aepp-sdk-js#develop
```

### 2. Import (a chosen Flavor)

Import the right [flavor](docs/usage.md). For this example with get the `Universal` flavor, which contains all the features of the SDK:

```js
import Ae from '@aeternity/aepp-sdk/es/ae/universal' // or other flavor
```

### 3. Create an Account and get some _AEs_
You can do many more things now, but you'll probably have to start with:

1. Create an account using the [ðŸ’» CLI](#cli---command-line-client)
2. Give yourself some initial _AEs_ using the [ðŸš° Faucet Aepp](https://faucet.aepps.com/)
3. Enjoy building Aepps ðŸ¤“
