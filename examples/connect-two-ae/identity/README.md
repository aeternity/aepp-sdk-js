# Wallet/Identity Base Aepp

This is part of the [connect-two-aepp](https://github.com/aeternity/aepp-sdk-js/tree/master/examples/connect-two-ae) example project.
Ths is an exmaple Aepp (Distributed App) that lives inside an Aeternity Wallet Aepp.

The [connect-two-aepp](https://github.com/aeternity/aepp-sdk-js/tree/master/examples/connect-two-ae) example project has been created to showcase the aeternity SDK implementation for both Base/Wallet Aepps and "regular" Aepps "depending" on a base (Wallet/Identity) Aepp.

## Overview

This is a sample Wallet/Identity Aepp that expects an Aepp to be loaded into an iFrame contained into this base aepp.

### How it works

1. Start this base Aepp, which will start on port `9000`
2. Start the [sample Contract Aepp](https://github.com/aeternity/aepp-sdk-js/tree/develop/examples/connect-two-ae/aepp), which will start on port `9001`
3. Visit `localhost:9000` to see this Aepp included into the Identity (Wallet) Aepp

## Installation

1. Clone this repo with `git clone`
2. Install required dependencies with `yarn install`


## Start the application

```
yarn run start:dev
```

The current form should be self explainatory.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:9001
yarn run start:dev

# build for production with minification
yarn run build

```
