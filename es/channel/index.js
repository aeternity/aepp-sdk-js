 * @param {Number} options.channelReserve - The minimum amount both peers need to maintain
 * @param {Number} [options.ttl] - Minimum block height to include the channel_create_tx
 * @param {String} options.host - Host of the responder's node
 * @param {Number} options.port - The port of the responders node
 * @param {Number} options.lockPeriod - Amount of blocks for disputing a solo close
 * @param {Number} [options.existingChannelId] - Existing channel id (required if reestablishing a channel)
 * @param {Number} [options.offchainTx] - Offchain transaction (required if reestablishing a channel)
 * @param {Number} [options.timeoutIdle] - The time waiting for a new event to be initiated (default: 600000)
 * @param {Number} [options.timeoutFundingCreate] - The time waiting for the initiator to produce the create channel transaction after the noise session had been established (default: 120000)
 * @param {Number} [options.timeoutFundingSign] - The time frame the other client has to sign an off-chain update after our client had initiated and signed it. This applies only for double signed on-chain intended updates: channel create transaction, deposit, withdrawal and etc. (default: 120000)
 * @param {Number} [options.timeoutFundingLock] - The time frame the other client has to confirm an on-chain transaction reaching maturity (passing minimum depth) after the local node has detected this. This applies only for double signed on-chain intended updates: channel create transaction, deposit, withdrawal and etc. (default: 360000)
 * @param {Number} [options.timeoutSign] - The time frame the client has to return a signed off-chain update or to decline it. This applies for all off-chain updates (default: 500000)
 * @param {Number} [options.timeoutAccept] - The time frame the other client has to react to an event. This applies for all off-chain updates that are not meant to land on-chain, as well as some special cases: opening a noise connection, mutual closing acknowledgement and reestablishing an existing channel (default: 120000)
 * @param {Number} [options.timeoutInitialized] - the time frame the responder has to accept an incoming noise session. Applicable only for initiator (default: timeout_accept's value)
 * @param {Number} [options.timeoutAwaitingOpen] - The time frame the initiator has to start an outgoing noise session to the responder's node. Applicable only for responder (default: timeout_idle's value)
 * @param {Function} options.sign - Function which verifies and signs transactions
