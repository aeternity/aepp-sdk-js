Common options These options are common and can be provided to every tx-type: onAccount (default: the first account defined in the account array of the SDK instance) You can specify the account that should be used to sign a transaction. Note: The account needs to be provided to the SDK instance in order to be used for signing. nonce (default: obtain nonce of the account via node API) The default behavior might cause problems if you perform many transactions in a short period of time. You might want to implement your own nonce management and provide the nonce \"manually\". 2 different strategies to use in order to determine the next nonce, See option strategy to learn more. strategy (default: max ) The strategy to obtain next nonce for an account via node API If set to max , then the greatest nonce seen in the account or currently in the transaction pool is incremented with 1 and returned. If the strategy is set to continuity , then transactions in the mempool are checked if there are gaps - missing nonces that prevent transactions with greater nonces to get included ttl (default: 0 ) Should be set if you want the transaction to be only valid until a certain block height is reached. fee (default: calculated for each tx-type) The minimum fee is dependent on the tx-type. You can provide a higher fee to additionally reward the miners. innerTx (default: false ) Should be used for signing an inner transaction that will be wrapped in a PayingForTx . verify (default: false ) If set to true the transaction will be verified prior to broadcasting it. waitMined (default: true ) Wait for transactions to be mined. You can get the tx object that contains the tx-hash immediately by setting to false and should implement your own logic to watch for mined transactions. Tx-type specific options The following options are sepcific for each tx-type. ContractCreateTx & ContractCallTx amount (default: 0 ) To be used for providing aettos (or AE with respective denomination) to a contract related transaction. denomination (default: aettos ) You can specify the denomination of the amount that will be provided to the contract related transaction. gasLimit Maximum amount of gas to be consumed by the transaction. Learn more on How to estimate gas? gasPrice (default: 1e9 ) To increase chances to get your transaction included quickly you can use a higher gasPrice. NameClaimTx nameFee (default: calculated based on the length of the name) The fee in aettos that will be payed to claim the name. For bids in an auction you need to explicitely calculate the required nameFee based on the last bid NameUpdateTx clientTtl (default: 84600 ) This option is an indicator for indexing tools to know how long (in seconds) they could or should cache the name information. nameTtl (default: 180000 ) This option tells the protocol the relative TTL based on the current block height. 180000 is the maximum possible value OracleRegisterTx queryFee (default: 30000 ) The fee in aettos that the oracle requests in order to provide a response. oracleTtlValue (default: 500 ) The TTL of the oracle that defines its expiration. oracleTtlType (default: ORACLE_TTL_TYPES.delta ) ORACLE_TTL_TYPES.delta : TTL value treated relative to a current block height ORACLE_TTL_TYPES.block : TTL value treated as absolute block height OracleQueryTx queryFee (default: 30000 ) The fee in aettos that will be payed to the oracle. queryTtlValue (default: 10 ) The TTL of the query that defines its expiration.

How to estimate gas? As \u00e6pp developer, it is reasonable to estimate the gas consumption for a contract call using the dry-run feature of the node once and provide a specific offset (e.g. multiplied by 1.5 or 2) as default in the \u00e6pp to ensure that contract calls are mined. Depending on the logic of the contract the gas consumption of a specific contract call can vary and therefore you should monitor the gas consumption and increase the default for the respective contract call accordingly over time. By default, SDK estimates gasLimit using dry-run endpoint.

Prerequisites A user wanting to release a new version needs to be a member of the @aeternity organization on npmjs.com. An existing member with write access needs to invite them in order to achieve this. In addition, the user needs to activate any means of 2-factor authentication because the aepp-sdk package is set up to only accept new versions if a second factor for authentication is in use. As new releases should only happen from release branch merges to the master branch of the repository on GitHub followed by a signed tag push, the user also needs direct write access to the repository on GitHub. Normally, this can be achieved by first adding them to the \u00e6ternity organization and then to the sdk team , which gives automatic write access. Branching Out As aepp-sdk follows the git-flow strategy for development, the release process is modelled after that strategy accordingly, with a few additions. Branch out from develop to a dedicated release branch denoting the target version number, e.g. release/v2.3.4 . Preparing a Pre-Release If Testnet is not yet targeting the latest Node version, but you're \"ready to release\", you can do a pre-release for the latest version, tagging the release as @next on npmjs. To do this, You can follow the steps listed below, while keeping the next portion in both CHANGELOG.md and package.json files. Preparing a Release On the release branch, remove the next portion of the version string in package.json . Execute npm run release to automatically bump version number in package.json and package-lock.json (according to Semantic Versioning ) output changes to CHANGELOG.md commit package-lock.json and package.json and CHANGELOG.md Next, git diff the release, branch a release/vX.X.X (where vX.X.X is your latest release) against master and validate that all changes are covered in the changelog. You can find more instructions on how to maintain a CHANGELOG here: https://keepachangelog.com PR against master Create a pull request against master and have it peer reviewed thoroughly. As all changes should've been reviewed before when they were merged to develop , emphasize on security-related changes and small changes pushed to develop separately. Merging Once the integration build has successfully completed (with or without additional fixes), merge (without squash) the branch into master . This allows master to be comprised of release commits exclusively, so every commit on master corresponds to exactly one released (or at least, tagged) version of aepp-sdk, respectively. Build, Release and Tag Update the local working copy to a local tracking branch of master and update. Optionally, wait for the CI build to finish and execute a last npm run test locally. Important: Because npm publish will use the local files on disk for releasing, perform a full clean and build in order to release to npmjs.com! Cleanup - run git clean -ffdx to completely wipe out your workspace of files not in the repository. This might wipe out files you still need, so consider a separate clone of the project! Execute npm run prepublishOnly to generate Documentation for the API and the SDK codebase, optionally followed by npm pack and investigate the resulting tarball's contents. This tarball resembles what users will actually download from npmjs.com once the release is completed! Execute npm publish and follow the on-screen instructions Important: If you are releasing a Pre-Release (AKA next ), make sure to tag the release as next using the command npm publish --tag next . At this point, the release should already be in npmjs.com. The final step is to also tag the release on GitHub and push the tag, which requires direct write access . git tag vX.X.X git push tag vX.X.X Recommendation: Use signed tags using the -s option to increase community's trust in the project! Merging Back into develop At this point, it is important to synchronize develop with any changes that have happened after branching out to the release branch. Create a new branch called realign/vX.X.X from master (where vX.X.X is your latest release) and open a Pull Request towards develop and resolve conflicts, if needed.

Create and sign ContractCallTx on behalf of new user Currently there is no high-level API available that allows you to create and sign the ContractCallTx by invoking the generated contract method on the contract instance that you typically use for contract calls. Following 4 steps need to be done: Initialize a contract instance by the source code and the contract address. Create calldata by calling the encode function providing the contract name, the name of the entrypoint to call as well as the required params. The entrypoint with the name set_latest_caller doesn't require any params so you can provide an empty array Create the ContractCreateTx by providing all required params. You could omit amount , gasLimit and gasPrice if you choose to stick to the default values (see transaction options ) Sign the transaction by providing innerTx: true as transaction option. The transaction will be signed in a special way that is required for inner transactions. const contract = await aeSdk . initializeContract ( { sourceCode : CONTRACT_SOURCE_CODE , address : CONTRACT_ADDRESS }, ); const calldata = contract . _calldata . encode ( 'PayingForTxExample' , 'set_last_caller' , []); const contractCallTx = await aeSdk . buildTx ( Tag .

If you successfully claimed a name it will expire after 180000 keyblocks (~375 days). You will need to update your name before it expires! 1. Claim a name Claiming an AENS name requires you (at least) 2 transactions: First you need to perform a pre-claim by providing a commitmentId (hash). The commitmentId is calculated with a random salt and the provided name. The SDK automatically generates the random salt , calculates the commitmentId and includes it into the NamePreclaimTx . After the NamePreclaimTx transaction has been mined you will be able to perform the actual claim of the name. When performing the actual claim via a NameClaimTx you will, depending on the length of the name: immediately become owner of that name initiate an auction Pre-claim // imports const aeSdk = new AeSdk ({ ... }) // init the SDK instance with AeSdk class const name = 'testNameForTheGuide.chain' const preClaimTx = await aeSdk . aensPreclaim ( name ) console . log ( preClaimTx ) /* { blockHash: 'mh_2UsggiUaQQmEPjxLnXkXHpm1WawTWqZb1jBx6UzsQNHgirWAwd', blockHeight: 449499, hash: 'th_48RktjEutZC8TCubaq9YhjaF1cKLV9D3VRCJyzJLs7oSp4Ry6', signatures: [ 'sg_Da98k2EKMun1TkE7ytonRypvJwaKg9iBjp8rNcYuodFXqzRqwjQyuFQP5DhxWUpTYRzSTurrNtDmUft8eyTStjCyNqFf8' ], tx: { accountId: 'ak_2519mBsgjJEVEFoRgno1ryDsn3BEaCZGRbXPEjThWYLX9MTpmk', commitmentId: 'cm_2igvW9egddKh77gDdE8mjotmL8PzE7Tf2Q639Q5stUqWQoEfap', fee: 16620000000000, nonce: 18, type: 'NamePreclaimTx', version: 1 }, rawTx: 'tx_+JkLAfhCuEBgFzAL0bPDufmzDq0558vaKtrIyRpNxCYVtkgnJjBrxDpQZHkfbwG+oRuBUAfgfrAKF0lO9mRI1zq0H6bXIq8KuFH4TyEBoQGMyNToF1flcYDSVsPl5DZ9ZY3FJWRpDRQYD32quWBEAhKhA+Jawe/spFaw823K+U59CWx+xD1i34gngUPiAAKJqv/fhg8dpTI4AAAGc20E', height: 449499, claim: [Function: claim], salt: 7595805618692717, commitmentId: 'cm_2igvW9egddKh77gDdE8mjotmL8PzE7Tf2Q639Q5stUqWQoEfap' } */ Note: After transaction is included, you have 300 keyblocks to broadcast claim transaction with the same salt and it should be signed with the same private key as pre-claim . As the pre-claim is required to avoid front running it is recommended to wait with the actual claim until at least 1 keyblock has been mined so that nobody knows which name you aim to claim. The corresponding claim cannot be included in the same keyblock anyway. The protocol doesn't allow that. You should check if the name is still available before performing a pre-claim . The protocol itself doesn't reject a pre-claim transaction if the name isn't available anymore. As you can see above in the logs the result ( preClaimTx ) of the aensPreclaim has bound a claim function that you can make use of to perform the actual claim. In case you want to perform the actual claim at a later point you should remember the salt that has been used for the pre-claim Claim This example assumes that you perform the actual claim manually by having remembered the required salt . In most cases you'd probably use the claim function that is bound to the result of the aensPreclaim function directly (see above). Depending on the length of the name the actual claim will result in direct ownership of the AENS name or start an auction: Name length > 12: ownership of the name is immediately transfered to your account Name length <= 12: an auction is started const salt = 7595805618692717 // salt from pre-claim transaction // the minimum `nameFee` will be automatically generated by sdk // in case you want to provide a custom `nameFee` you can so so by providing it in an options object // in case of starting the auction `nameFee` will be the starting bid const claimTx = await aeSdk . aensClaim ( name , salt ) console . log ( claimTx ) /* { blockHash: 'mh_UvtuVNvK7k29G3anF48W4hgUMaFFLc1wKir55FFifgT49Egk', blockHeight: 449507, hash: 'th_2sWNusGUf2wuRn7d453wPWTAe8pKVbtNF4DqakvippsxjvF8g1', signatures: [ 'sg_LYsVj9zUoKFPDiSvFUWG5QaRhnqQ525YA314xMVzRhApYuPnFyMWgAQGpChKHHWyMbykBwVRrmoQtTENTFCaCoMj17CBK' ], tx: { accountId: 'ak_2519mBsgjJEVEFoRgno1ryDsn3BEaCZGRbXPEjThWYLX9MTpmk', fee: 16800000000000, name: 'testNameForTheGuide.chain', nameFee: '2865700000000000000', nameSalt: '7595805618692717', nonce: 19, type: 'NameClaimTx', version: 2 }, rawTx: 'tx_+KILAfhCuECVba2mm3Un3nrN9U+LpuB2wzqDDmAzXwvc+9sVkpkcALzqm14p7kGqyt8pwjGTyKeLM9lp+KgXWF4PHmHz0WAPuFr4WCACoQGMyNToF1flcYDSVsPl5DZ9ZY3FJWRpDRQYD32quWBEAhOZdGVzdE5hbWVGb3JUaGVHdWlkZS5jaGFpboca/FhPr2JtiCfFAveE1kAAhg9HjghAAADilhgr', id: 'nm_1Cz5HGY8PMWZxNrM6s51CtsJZDU3DDT1LdmpEipa3DRghyGz5', owner: 'ak_2519mBsgjJEVEFoRgno1ryDsn3BEaCZGRbXPEjThWYLX9MTpmk', pointers: [], ttl: 629507, update: [Function (anonymous)], transfer: [Function (anonymous)], revoke: [Function (anonymous)], extendTtl: [Function (anonymous)] } */ Note: The nameFee that is required will be correctly calculated automatically for the initial claim. It's still possible to pass it as additional param, see transaction options . In case the claim triggers an auction the required nameFee is locked by the protocol. If you win the auction the nameFee is permanently deducted from your accounts balance and effectively burned . It will be credited to ak_11111111111111111111111111111111273Yts which nobody can access. This reduces the total supply of AE over time.

After a timeout of 2016 keyblocks the name will be available for claiming again. Delegate signature to contract (AENS interface) It is possible to authorize a Sophia contract to manage an AENS name on behalf of your account. In order to achieve that you need to provide a delegation signature to the contract. The contract will then be able to use the AENS interface and perform AENS related actions on behalf of your account. This functionality could for example be used to build an AENS marketplace. // imports const aeSdk = new AeSdk ({ ... }) // init the SDK instance with AeSdk class // contract address const contractId = 'ct_asd2ks...' // AENS name const name = 'example.chain' // Sign with a specific account const onAccount = aeSdk . address // this signature will allow the contract to perform a pre-claim on your behalf const preClaimSig = await aeSdk . createAensDelegationSignature ( contractId , { onAccount }) // this signature will allow the contract to perform // any name related transaction for a specific name that you own const aensDelegationSig = await aeSdk . createAensDelegationSignature ( contractId , { name , onAccount })","title":"AENS (\u00e6ternity naming system)"},{"location":"guides/aens/#aens-ternity-naming-system","text":"","title":"AENS (\u00e6ternity naming system)"},{"location":"guides/aens/#introduction","text":"This guide shows you how to perform all the operations that you need within the lifecycle of \u00e6ternity naming system (AENS) using the SDK.

As the pre-claim is required to avoid front running it is recommended to wait with the actual claim until at least 1 keyblock has been mined so that nobody knows which name you aim to claim. The corresponding claim cannot be included in the same keyblock anyway. The protocol doesn't allow that. You should check if the name is still available before performing a pre-claim . The protocol itself doesn't reject a pre-claim transaction if the name isn't available anymore. As you can see above in the logs the result ( preClaimTx ) of the aensPreclaim has bound a claim function that you can make use of to perform the actual claim.

Multiple spend transactions Obviously, multiple spends may be done like: for ( const { address , amount } of spends ) { await aeSdk . spend ( amount , address ) } But this isn't the fastest approach, because on each iteration SDK would: request the sender data (its type and nonce) verify the transaction (including additional requests) wait until the transaction is mined It can be avoided by making spends as: const base = ( await aeSdk . api . getAccountNextNonce ( aeSdk . address )). nextNonce await Promise . all ( spends . map (({ amount , address }, idx ) => aeSdk . spend ( amount , address , { nonce : base + idx , verify : false , waitMined : false })) ) This way, SDK would make a single request to get info about the sender account and a transaction post request per each item in the spends array. Multiple contract static calls Basically, the dry-run endpoint of the node is used to run them. Doing requests one by one, like const results = [] for ( const d of data ) { results . push ( await contract . foo ( d )) } will make SDK create a new dry-run request for each static call.

Also, it is necessary to generate increasing nonces on the aepp side to avoid nonce-already-used errors. This approach has another limitation: by default, dry-run is limited by 6000000 gas.

It is a functional language in the ML family, strongly typed and has restricted mutable state. Before interacting with contracts using the SDK you should get familiar with Sophia itself first. Have a look into aepp-sophia-examples and start rapid prototyping using AEstudio . The SDK needs to interact with following components in order to enable smart contract interactions on the \u00e6ternity blockchain: \u00e6ternity (host your own one or use the public testnet node at https://testnet.aeternity.io ) aesophia_http (host your own one or use the public compiler at https://v7.compiler.aepps.com ) Note: For production deployments you should always host these services by yourself. 1. Specify imports // node.js import const { AeSdk , MemoryAccount , Node , CompilerHttp } = require ( '@aeternity/aepp-sdk' ) // ES import import { AeSdk , MemoryAccount , Node , CompilerHttp } from '@aeternity/aepp-sdk' 2. Create an instance of the SDK When creating an instance of the SDK you need to provide an account which will be used to sign transactions like ContractCreateTx and ContractCallTx that will be broadcasted to the network. const node = new Node ( 'https://testnet.aeternity.io' ) // ideally host your own node const account = new MemoryAccount ( SECRET_KEY ) const aeSdk = new AeSdk ({ nodes : [{ name : 'testnet' , instance : node }], accounts : [ account ], onCompiler : new CompilerHttp ( 'https://v7.compiler.aepps.com' ), // ideally host your own compiler }) Note: You can provide multiple accounts to the SDK. For each transaction you can choose a specific account to use for signing (by default the first account will be used), see transaction options . This is specifically important and useful for writing tests. 3. Initialize the contract instance By source code const sourceCode = ... // source code of the contract const contract = await aeSdk . initializeContract ({ sourceCode }) Note: If your contract includes external dependencies which are not part of the standard library you should initialize the contract using: const fileSystem = ... // key-value map with name of the include as key and source code of the include as value const contract = await aeSdk . initializeContract ({ sourceCode , fileSystem }) By ACI and bytecode If you pre-compiled the contracts you can also initialize a contract instance by providing ACI and bytecode: const aci = ... // ACI of the contract const bytecode = ... // bytecode of the contract const contract = await aeSdk . initializeContract ({ aci , bytecode }) By ACI and contract address In many cases an application doesn't need to deploy a contract or verify its bytecode. In this case you'd want to initialize the instance by just providing the ACI and the contract address. This is also possible: const aci = ... // ACI of the contract const address = ... // the address of the contract const contract = await aeSdk . initializeContract ({ aci , address }) Options Following attributes can be provided via options to initializeContract : aci (default: obtained via http compiler) The Contract ACI. address The address where the contract is located at. To be used if a contract is already deployed. fileSystem (default: {}) Key-value map with name of the include as key and source code of the include as value. validateBytecode (default: false) Compare source code with on-chain version. other transaction options which will be provided to every transaction that is initiated using the contract instance. You should be aware that: For most of these additional options it doesn't make sense to define them at contract instance level. You wouldn't want to provide an amount to each transaction or use the same nonce which would result in invalid transactions. For options like ttl or gasPrice it does absolutely make sense to set this on contract instance level. 4. Deploy the contract If you have a Sophia contract source code that looks like this: contract Increment = record state = { count : int } entrypoint init ( start : int ) = { count = start } stateful entrypoint increment ( value : int ) = put ( state { count = state . count + value }) entrypoint get_count () = state . count The contract can be deployed using the contract in two different ways: const tx = await contract . $deploy ([ 1 ]) // or const tx = await contract . init ( 1 ) // after successful deployment you can look up the transaction and the deploy information console . log ( tx ) // { owner, transaction, address, result, rawTx } Note: Deployment is only possible if the contract instance was initialized by providing source code or bytecode. The init entrypoint is a special function which is only called once for deployment, initializes the contract's state and doesn't require the stateful declaration. In Sophia all public functions are called entrypoints and need to be declared as stateful if they should produce changes to the state of the smart contract, see increment(value: int) . 5. Call contract entrypoints a) Stateful entrypoints According to the example above you can call the stateful entrypoint increment by using one of the following lines: const tx = await contract . increment ( 3 ) // recommended // or const tx = await contract . increment ( 3 , { callStatic : false }) // or const tx = await contract . $call ( 'increment' , [ 3 ]) Note: The callStatic: false option provide an explicit way to tell the SDK to sign and broadcast the transaction. When using the increment function directly the SDK will automatically determine if it's a stateful entrypoint. b) Regular entrypoints The \u00e6ternity node can expose an API endpoint that allows to execute a dry-run for a transaction. You can make use of that functionality to get the result of entrypoints that don't execute state changes. Following lines show how you can do that using the SDK for the get_count entrypoint of the example above: const tx = await contract . get_count () // recommended // or const tx = await contract . get_count ({ callStatic : true }) // access the decoded result returned by the execution of the entrypoint console . log ( tx . decodedResult ); Note: The callStatic option provide an explicit way to tell the SDK to perform a dry-run and to NOT broadcast the transaction. When using the get_count function directly the SDK will automatically determine that the function is not declared stateful and thus perform a dry-run , too. c) Payable entrypoints You will probably also write functions that require an amount of aettos to be provided. These functions must be declared with payable and (most likely) stateful . Let's assume you have declared following Sophia entrypoint which checks if a required amount of aettos has been provided before it continues execution: payable stateful entrypoint fund_project ( project_id : int ) = require ( Call . value >= 50 , 'at least 50 aettos need to be provided' ) // further logic ... In order to successfully call the fund_project entrypoint you need to provide at least 50 aettos . You can do this by providing the desired amount of aettos using one of the following lines: const tx = await contract . fund_project ( 1 , { amount : 50 }) // recommended // or const tx = await contract . $call ( 'fund_project' , [ 1 ], { amount : 50 }) Transaction options As already stated various times in the guide it is possible to provide transaction options as object to a function of the SDK that builds and potentially broadcasts a transaction. This object can be passed as additional param to each of these functions and overrides the default settings.

Prerequisite Run the code from below you need: - a Ledger Hardware Wallet like Ledger Nano X, Ledger Nano S - to install Ledger Live - to install aeternity@0.4.4 or above app from Ledger Live to HW - to have Ledger HW connected to computer, unlocked, with aeternity app opened Usage To work with accounts on Ledger HW firstly you need to choose a transport implementation. Ledger HW can be connected through USB or Bluetooth using a specific NPM package . After creating a transport instance you need to create a factory of Ledger accounts import { AccountLedgerFactory } from '@aeternity/aepp-sdk' ; const accountFactory = new AccountLedgerFactory ( transport ); Using the factory, you can create instances of specific accounts by providing an index const account = await accountFactory . initialize ( 0 ); console . log ( account . address ); // 'ak_2dA...' console . log ( await account . signTransaction ( 'tx_...' )); // 'tx_...' (with signature added) The private key for the account would be derived on the Ledger device using the provided index and the mnemonic phrase it was initialized with. The complete examples of how to use it in nodejs and browser can be found here . Account verification To protect from MITM attacks is it recommended to ensure that the accessed account is the account actually available on Ledger. To do so, the app should show to user the address it have access to, the same as Ledger HW should show the address on its screen, and user should ensure that addresses the same. To trigger verification process you need to use getAddress method await accountFactory . getAddress ( < account index > , true ) Account persistence Account can be persisted and restored by saving values of index , address properties import { AccountLedger } from '@aeternity/aepp-sdk' ; const accountIndex = accountToPersist . index ; const accountAddress = accountToPersist . address ; const restoredAccount = new AccountLedger ( transport , accountIndex , accountAddress ); It can be used to remember accounts between app restarts. Account discovery In addition to the above, it is possible to get access to a sequence of accounts that already have been used on chain. It is needed, for example, to restore the previously used accounts in case the user connects Ledger HW to an app that doesn't aware of them. import { Node } from '@aeternity/aepp-sdk' ; const node = new Node ( 'https://testnet.aeternity.io' ); const accounts = await accountFactory . discover ( node ); console . log ( accounts [ 0 ]. address ); // 'ak_2dA...'","title":"Ledger Hardware Wallet"},{"location":"guides/ledger-wallet/#ledger-hardware-wallet","text":"This guide explains basic interactions on getting access to aeternity accounts on Ledger Hardware Wallet using JS SDK.","title":"Ledger Hardware Wallet"},{"location":"guides/ledger-wallet/#prerequisite","text":"Run the code from below you need: - a Ledger Hardware Wallet like Ledger Nano X, Ledger Nano S - to install Ledger Live - to install aeternity@0.4.4 or above app from Ledger Live to HW - to have Ledger HW connected to computer, unlocked, with aeternity app opened","title":"Prerequisite"},{"location":"guides/ledger-wallet/#usage","text":"To work with accounts on Ledger HW firstly you need to choose a transport implementation.

Oracle: register You register an oracle that responds with the temperature of the city that is included in the query. To register an oracle you need to provide a queryFormat and a responseFormat to the registerOracle function of the SDK. In addition to the common transaction options you can provide the oracle specific options queryFee and oracleTtlValue , see transaction options . // init an instance of the SDK using the AeSdk class const aeSdk = new AeSdk ({ ... }) // set TTL with a delta of 1000 blocks const oracleTtlOptions = { oracleTtlType : ORACLE_TTL_TYPES . delta , oracleTtlValue : 1000 } // OR set a specific block height to expire const oracleTtlOptions = { oracleTtlType : ORACLE_TTL_TYPES . block , oracleTtlValue : 555555 } // queryFee is optional and defaults to 30000 // oracleTtlValue is optional and defaults to 500 // oracleTtlType is optional and defaults to ORACLE_TTL_TYPES.delta const options = { queryFee : 1337 , ... oracleTtlOptions } // the first argument is the queryFormat and the second is the responseFormat const oracle = await aeSdk . registerOracle ( \"{'city': string}\" , \"{'temperature': int}\" , options ) Note: By default the oracle will exist for the next 500 KeyBlocks. If you intend to keep your oracle running longer you should increase the oracleTtlValue and/or set up a service that automatically extends the TTL before it expires. The oracleId will be similar to the address of the account that registered the Oracle. The only difference is the prefix that will be ok_ instead of ak_ This means that each account can only host 1 oracle. It's not possible to manage multiple oracles using the same account. 2. Some party: query an oracle and poll for response Query After the oracle has been registered and as long as it isn't expired, everybody that knows the oracleId can query it. const oracleId = 'ok_...' ; const options = { queryFee : 1337 , // should cover the requested fee of the oracle and defaults to 30000 queryTtlType : ORACLE_TTL_TYPES . delta , // optional and defaults to ORACLE_TTL_TYPES.delta queryTtlValue : 20 , // optional and defaults to 10 responseTtlType : ORACLE_TTL_TYPES . delta , // optional and defaults to ORACLE_TTL_TYPES.delta responseTtlValue : 50 , // optional and defaults to 10 }; // using the oracle object in case you need to instantiate the oracle object first const oracle = await aeSdk . getOracleObject ( oracleId ) const query = await oracle . postQuery ( \"{'city': 'Berlin'}\" , options ) // OR using the aeSdk (instance of AeSdk class) directly by providing the oracleId const query = await aeSdk . postQueryToOracle ( oracleId , \"{'city': 'Berlin'}\" , options ) Note: Again, take a look into the transaction options to see what (other) options you can provide. Poll for response Now you have access to the query object and can poll for the response to that specific query: const oracleId = 'ok_...' ; const queryId = 'oq_...' ; // using the query instance const query = await aeSdk . getQueryObject ( oracleId , queryId ) // in case you need to get the query instance first const response = await query . pollForResponse ({ interval : 6000 }) // OR using the aeSdk (instance of AeSdk class) directly by providing the oracleId const response = await aeSdk . pollForQueryResponse ( oracleId , queryId , { interval : 6000 }) // decode the oracle response // the decode function returns a buffer that needs to be converted to a string const decodedResponse = String ( response . decode ()); console . log ( decodedResponse ) 3. Oracle: poll for queries and respond Poll for queries Typically the oracle itself polls for its own queries and responds as soon as possible: const stopPolling = await oracle . pollQueries (( queries ) => { console . log ( queries ) // log all new queries }, { interval : 1000 }) // polling interval in milliseconds stopPolling () // stop polling Note: Probably the oracle would respond here directly (see below) instead of just logging the queries. Respond to query If the oracle recognizes that it has been queried it can respond to the query as long as the query's TTL has not been expired. const oracleId = 'ok_...' ; const queryId = 'oq_...' ; const options = { onAccount : 'ak_...' } // only the account of the oracle can respond to the query // using the query instance const query = await aeSdk . getQueryObject ( oracleId , queryId ) await query . respond ( '{ \"temperature\": 27.5 }' , options ) // OR using the aeSdk (instance of AeSdk class) directly by providing the oracleId and the queryId await aeSdk . respondToQuery ( oracleId , queryId , '{ \"temperature\": 27.5 }' , options ) Note: Of course the oracle itself would either use an API to get the current temperature for a certain city or ideally directly communicate with measuring devices located in that specific city. If the AeSdk class is initialized with the oracle's account there is no need to pass the onAccount option as this is done implicitely. 4. Oracle: extend As mentioned above an Oracle has a certain TTL that can be specified when registering it. You might want to extend the TTL of the oracle before it expires. You can do that as follows: const oracleId = 'ok_...' ; // extend TTL by additional 500 blocks (based on current expiration height of the oracle) const options = { oracleTtlType : ORACLE_TTL_TYPES . delta , oracleTtlValue : 500 } // using the oracle instance const oracle = await aeSdk . getOracleObject ( oracleId ) const extendedOracle = await oracle . extendOracle ( options ) // OR using the aeSdk (instance of AeSdk class) directly by providing the oracleId const extendedOracle = await aeSdk . extendOracleTtl ( oracleId , options ) Example applications ae-oracle-pricefeed NodeJS example that registers an oracle, extends it if required and responds to queries automatically.","title":"Oracles"},{"location":"guides/oracles/#oracles","text":"","title":"Oracles"},{"location":"guides/oracles/#introduction","text":"This guide shows you how to perform all the operations that you need within the lifecycle of oracles using the SDK.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"guides/oracles/#1-oracle-register","text":"You register an oracle that responds with the temperature of the city that is included in the query.

For example: contract . methods . listFn ( '[1, 2]' , { skipArgsConvert : false }) rewrite to contract . methods . listFn ([ 1 , 2 ]) removed skipTransformDecoded option of contract call and deployment ( bb49239 ) Decoding to JavaScript types is enforced, please use it instead. ak_ addresses are not accepted as hashes, bytes, and signatures anymore ( cbaac62 ) Encode addresses as an ak_ -prefixed string instead. removed contractEncodeCall ( a4b303f ) Use contractEncodeCallDataAPI instead. removed contractDecodeData ( 5df2285 ) Use contractDecodeCallResultAPI instead. removed setOptions on contract instance ( b88e767 ) Pass them through getContractInstance options instead. contractCallStatic , contractCall , contractDeploy are deprecated now ( c4ec019 ) Use getContractInstance instead. Also, these methods will accept JavaScript-type variables instead of Sophia-encoded. For example: sdk . contractCallStatic ( source , address , methodName , [ '42' ]) should be replaced with sdk . contractCallStatic ( source , address , methodName , [ 42 ]) dropped compatibility with compiler@4.1.0 ( f9cef12 ) Use compiler 6.0.0 and above. invert and rename forceCodeCheck option to validateBytecode in getContractInstance ( 72122fa ) Use validateBytecode when you need to ensure that the source code/bytecode provided to getContractInstance corresponds to the on-chain bytecode. removed getConsensusProtocolVersion method ( 75f0447 ) Use node.consensusProtocolVersion instead. switched to @aeternity/aepp-calldata package ( #1313 ) Numbers in Sophia are not limited in size. Before they were returned from contract methods as usual JavaScript numbers that have limited accuracy. To fix this, we make it return instances of BigInt. Variant types are now supported by sdk, so replace \"RelativeTTL(50)\" with { RelativeTTL: [50] } . As an exception Some(value) is converted to the exact value in JavaScript and None is converted to undefined (Sophia's option type). Contract methods will accept/return instances of JavaScript's Map as variables of Sophia's map type. Objects are not accepted as maps any longer. Sophia's hash , signature , bytes types return values as Uint8Array instead of a hex-encoded string. Check the documentation of calldata package for additional info. Use .decodedResult instead of .decode() to get the result of method call. Most of the errors thrown by contract iterations will be different due to doing validation using calldata package instead of joi . pass source in options of sdk.getContractInstance ( 5c690d2 ) For example: sdk . getContractInstance ( contractSource , { contractAddress : '...' }) rewrite to sdk . getContractInstance ({ source : contractSource , contractAddress : '...' }) Contract instance can be generated by ACI and bytecode: sdk . getContractInstance ({ aci , bytecode }) SDK won't use hosted compiler in this case.

This may be an issue if you are using aepp-sdk with Vue@3, because Vue@3 introduced reactivity based on Proxy class ( Vue docs ). Avoid the above error by not making instances of these classes reactive. all combined exports are inlined ( require('@aeternity/aepp-sdk').generateKeyPair() ) Import the needed utils directly instead of importing a wrapper object firstly. For example: -import { Crypto } from '@aeternity/aepp-sdk' +import { generateKeyPair } from '@aeternity/aepp-sdk' -console.log(Crypto.generateKeyPair()) +console.log(generateKeyPair()) AccountBase and inheritors are classes now Use new to create an instance. ChainNode , Contract , Oracle , Aens , GeneralizedAccount stamps not exported Their methods exported instead. Outside of AeSdkBase context, they may accept onAccount , onNode , onCompiler options. Node and Compiler Node , Compiler (previously ContractCompilerHttp ) are classes instead of a stamps For example: import { Node } from '@aeternity/aepp-sdk' -const node = await Node({ url, ignoreVersion: false }) +const node = new Node(url, { ignoreVersion: false }) Node , Compiler doesn't check version on the first request instead of init Don't handle new Node(...) and new Compiler(...) as a Promise . getNetworkId returns a promise getNetworkId ignores force option So, it would throw exception in case networkId is not provided. Use try/catch instead. api is removed in Node Use node.getBalance instead of node.api.getBalance. static properties are removed in Node Use node.getStatus() or node.getNodeInfo() to get values of version , revision , genesisHash , nodeNetworkId , consensusProtocolVersion . Node returns BigInts for coin amount fields instead of string or number Node not accepts internalUrl Node doesn't accepts and stores internalUrl , also internal endpoints are not available anymore. If necessary, create a wrapper of internal API separately ( swagger-client package). removed mempool method in Node Create a wrapper of internal API by genSwaggerClient and use getPendingTransactions method instead. compilerVersion is removed in Compiler Use compilerApi.aPIVersion() method instead. setCompilerUrl changes compiler URL in sync Don't handle aeSdk.setCompilerUrl(...) as a Promise . methods of Compiler requires options object according to their specification methods of Compiler returns and accepts keys named in camelCase instead of snake_case Transaction builder removed methods to generate a transaction of specific type Use aeSdk.buildTx(txType, params) instead. removed ability to generate transaction on the node side Use aeSdk.buildTx(txType, params) instead. nonce , ttl , gas decoded and accepted as numbers instead of strings gas renamed to gasLimit Use gasLimit instead of gas everywhere except for transaction details returned by node. unpackTx not accepting transaction as Buffer , only as tx-encoded string Use unpackTx(encode(tx, 'tx')) instead. unpackTx doesn't have binary field in result Use require('rlp').decode(unpackTx(tx).rlpEncoded) instead. encode: since the prefix is evaluated by the type itself the required prefix parameter is no more accepted For example: -decode('cb_DA6sWJo=', 'cb') +decode('cb_DA6sWJo=') calculateMinFee returns BigNumber instead of string Fee helpers not exported anymore ( BASE_GAS , GAS_PER_BYTE , KEY_BLOCK_INTERVAL , TX_FEE_BASE_GAS , TX_FEE_OTHER_GAS , calculateFee , DEFAULT_FEE ) Use a general calculateMinFee instead. buildRawTx , calculateTtl not exported anymore Use a general buildTx method instead. TX_TYPE mapped to tag (number) instead of string Always use TX_TYPE . To get type name by tag use TX_TYPE[tag] . OBJECT_ID_TX_TYPE not exported anymore Use TX_TYPE[tag] instead. TX_SERIALIZATION_SCHEMA combined with TX_DESERIALIZATION_SCHEMA Use TX_SCHEMA[TX_TYPE.*] instead. Transaction schemas doesn't contain tag anymore Use OBJECT_ID_TX_TYPE to find tag by transaction type. AENS computeBidFee accepts startFee , increment as options NAME_BID_TIMEOUTS not exposed anymore Use computeAuctionEndBlock function instead. computeAuctionEndBlock accepts and returns height as number removed ensureNameValid Use a TypeScript check instead. name.update , name.revoke doesn't accept address in onAccount Pass an instance of AccountBase to onAccount option instead. Oracle extendOracleTtl accepts oracle ttl in oracleTtlType and oracleTtlValue fields Use oracleTtlType field instead of type , and oracleTtlValue field instead of value . decode method of getQueryObject removed Use decode function instead. Contract createAensDelegationSignature first argument not an object contractId accepted as the first argument, name should be passed as option to the second one. createOracleDelegationSignature first argument not an object contractId accepted as the first argument, queryId should be passed as option to the second one. call arguments in createGeneralizedAccount is required Pass an empty array if you need no arguments. filesystem option renamed to fileSystem Contract instance doesn't accept address in onAccount It should be an instance of AccountBase instead. Chain removed balance method Use getBalance instead. removed tx method Use node.getTransactionByHash/getTransactionInfoByHash instead. removed getTxInfo method Use node.getTransactionInfoByHash instead. Other getAccountNonce removed Use node.getAccountNextNonce instead. AeSdk doesn't accept array of accounts Use aeSdk.addAccount method instead. destroyInstance method removed It wasn't doing anything, just remove it's usages. NodePool is removed Use AeSdkBase or AeSdk instead. AccountMultiple is removed Use AeSdk instead. DENOMINATION_MAGNITUDE not exposed anymore It is intended for internal use only. The result of unpackTx returned instead of TxObject In txObject option of onSign handler on wallet side. In tx field of contract call result. validateKeyObj removed Rely on TypeScript checks instead. deriveKeyUsingArgon2id removed Use argon2-browser package instead. removed extra implementation of getAddressFromPriv in keystore Use Crypto.getAddressFromPriv instead. genSwaggerClient removed Use swagger-client package instead. Aepp Wallet communication BrowserRuntimeConnection, BrowserWindowMessageConnection are classes Create instances using new. ContentScriptBridge, WalletDetector rewrited to plain functions Use connectionProxy , walletDetector accordingly. RpcClient: removed origin property Use connection property instead. RpcClient: sendMessage is a private method Use request or notify instead. RpcClient: handlers parameter is removed Provide a methods parameter instead of handlers[0] . Provide an onDisconnect parameter instead of handlers[1] . RpcClient: doesn't contain aepp info anymore Get aepp info in onConnection callback, and store somehow to use later. RpcClient: doesn't contain networkId anymore On wallet side: assume that all aepps uses the same network as the wallet connected to. On aepp side: use networkId that wallet provided. In case networkId is not compatible ask user to switch wallet to a compatible network. RPC helpers are not exposed anymore ( isInIframe , sendMessage , getHandler , message , responseMessage , sendResponseMessage , isValidAccounts ) Use own implementation if needed. Aepp connectToWallet accepts wallet connection as the first argument See connect-aepp-to-wallet.md for details. disconnectWallet runs in sync and sendDisconnect arg removed So, aepp would always send closeConnection notification. sendConnectRequest removed Use connectToWallet instead. doesn't accept connection anymore Use connectToWallet method instead. removed isConnected , isSubscribedAccount methods Detect is aepp connected by persistence of rpcClient property. signMessage returns Buffer by default Use returnHex option to get the previous behaviour. Wallet BrowserRuntimeConnection requires port parameter Pass require('webextension-polyfill').runtime.connect() to it. requires id , type in params id should be a unique string; type should be one of WALLET_TYPE.window , WALLET_TYPE.extension . getBrowserAPI helper removed Use webextension-polyfill package instead. shareWalletInfo accepts rpc client id instead of callback For example: const connection = new BrowserRuntimeConnection({ port }) -aeSdk.addRpcClient(connection) -aeSdk.shareWalletInfo(port.postMessage.bind(port)) +const rpcClientId = aeSdk.addRpcClient(connection) +aeSdk.shareWalletInfo(rpcClientId) shareNode argument in accept callback of onConnection removed Just deny the connection if you don't want to share the node url. can't handle specific set of accounts for an app If you need this feature, create a custom wallet implementation or fill us an issue. txObject parameter of onSign callback is removed Use unpackTx(tx) on wallet side instead. rpcClients in wallet is not exposed anymore This expected to be used only internally. onDisconnect callback on wallet side accepts client id instead of RpcClient Use sdk.rpcClient[clientId] to get the corresponding instance of RpcClient. wallet can't selectively notify aepps about selecting/adding account If you need this feature, create a custom wallet implementation or fill us an issue. wallet can't provide metadata for accounts If you need this feature, create a custom wallet implementation or fill us an issue. removed action.accept in permission callbacks Return the value you passed to accept instead. removed action.deny in permission callbacks Throw instances of RpcRejectedByUserError instead. callbacks accept client id, params, and origin","title":"Migration to 12.0.0"},{"location":"guides/migration/12.0.0/#migration-to-1200","text":"This guide describes all breaking changes introduced with v12.0.0 .","title":"Migration to 12.0.0"},{"location":"guides/migration/12.0.0/#general","text":"","title":"General"},{"location":"guides/migration/12.0.0/#universal-rpcaepp-rpcwallet-ae-stamps-are-removed","text":"Use AeSdk , AeSdkAepp , AeSdkWallet , AeSdbBase accordingly.
