# Oracles

## Introduction

This guide shows you how to perform all the operations that you need within the lifecycle of [oracles](https://docs.aeternity.com/protocol/oracles) using the SDK.

## 1. Oracle: register
You register an oracle that responds with the temperature of the city that is included in the query.

To register an oracle you need to provide a `queryFormat` and a `responseFormat` to the `registerOracle` function of the SDK. In addition to the common transaction options you can provide the oracle specific options `queryFee` and `oracleTtlValue`, see [transaction options](../transaction-options.md#oracleregistertx).

```js
// init an instance of the SDK using the AeSdk class
const aeSdk = new AeSdk({ ... })

// set TTL with a delta of 1000 blocks
const oracleTtlOptions = { oracleTtlType: ORACLE_TTL_TYPES.delta, oracleTtlValue: 1000 }
// OR set a specific block height to expire
const oracleTtlOptions = { oracleTtlType: ORACLE_TTL_TYPES.block, oracleTtlValue: 555555 }

// queryFee is optional and defaults to 0
// oracleTtlValue is optional and defaults to 500
// oracleTtlType is optional and defaults to ORACLE_TTL_TYPES.delta
const options = { queryFee: 1337, ...oracleTtlOptions }

// the first argument is the queryFormat and the second is the responseFormat
const oracle = await aeSdk.registerOracle('{"city": "str"}', '{"temperature": "int"}', options)
```

Note:

- By default the oracle will exist for the next 500 KeyBlocks.
- If you intend to keep your oracle running longer you should increase the `oracleTtlValue` and/or set up a service that automatically extends the TTL before it expires.
- The `oracleId` will be similar to the address of the account that registered the Oracle.
   - The only difference is the prefix that will be `ok_` instead of `ak_`
   - This means that each account can only host 1 oracle. It's not possible to manage multiple oracles using the same account.

## 2. Some party: query an oracle and poll for response

### Query
After the oracle has been registered and as long as it isn't expired, everybody that knows the `oracleId` can query it.

```js
const oracleId = 'ok_...';

const options = {
  queryFee: 1337, // should cover the requested fee of the oracle and defaults to 0
  queryTtlType: ORACLE_TTL_TYPES.delta, // optional and defaults to ORACLE_TTL_TYPES.delta
  queryTtlValue: 20, // optional and defaults to 10
  responseTtlType: ORACLE_TTL_TYPES.delta, // optional and defaults to ORACLE_TTL_TYPES.delta
  responseTtlValue: 50, // optional and defaults to 10
};

// using the oracle object in case you need to instantiate the oracle object first
const oracle = await aeSdk.getOracleObject(oracleId)
const query = await oracle.postQuery('{"city": "Berlin"}', options)

// OR using the aeSdk (instance of AeSdk class) directly by providing the oracleId
const query = await aeSdk.postQueryToOracle(oracleId, '{"city": "Berlin"}', options)
```

Note:

- Again, take a look into the [transaction options](../transaction-options.md#oraclequerytx) to see what (other) options you can provide.

### Poll for response
Now you have access to the query object and can poll for the response to that specific query:

```js
const oracleId = 'ok_...';
const queryId = 'oq_...';

// using the query instance
const query = await aeSdk.getQueryObject(oracleId, queryId) // in case you need to get the query instance first
const response = await query.pollForResponse({ interval: 6000 })

// OR using the aeSdk (instance of AeSdk class) directly by providing the oracleId
const response = await aeSdk.pollForQueryResponse(oracleId, queryId, { interval: 6000 })

// decode the oracle response
// the decode function returns a buffer that needs to be converted to a string
const decodedResponse = String(response.decode());
console.log(decodedResponse)
```

## 3. Oracle: poll for queries and respond

### Poll for queries
Typically, the oracle itself polls for its own queries and responds as soon as possible:

```js
const stopPolling = await oracle.pollQueries((query) => {
  console.log(query) // log a new query
}, { interval: 1000 }) // polling interval in milliseconds

stopPolling() // stop polling
```

Note:

- Probably the oracle would respond here directly (see below) instead of just logging the queries.

### Respond to query
If the oracle recognizes that it has been queried it can respond to the query as long as the query's TTL
has not been expired.

```js
const oracleId = 'ok_...';
const queryId = 'oq_...';
const options = { onAccount: 'ak_...' } // only the account of the oracle can respond to the query

// using the query instance
const query = await aeSdk.getQueryObject(oracleId, queryId)
await query.respond('{"temperature": 27.5}', options)

// OR using the aeSdk (instance of AeSdk class) directly by providing the queryId
await aeSdk.respondToQuery(queryId, '{"temperature": 27.5}', options)
```

Note:

- Of course the oracle itself would either use an API to get the current temperature for a certain city or ideally directly communicate with measuring devices located in that specific city.
- If the AeSdk class is initialized with the oracle's account there is no need to pass the `onAccount` option as this is done implicitely.

## 4. Oracle: extend
As mentioned above an Oracle has a certain TTL that can be specified when registering it. You might want to extend the TTL of the oracle before it expires. You can do that as follows:

```js
const oracleId = 'ok_...';

// extend TTL by additional 500 blocks (based on current expiration height of the oracle)
const options = { oracleTtlType: ORACLE_TTL_TYPES.delta, oracleTtlValue: 500 }

// using the oracle instance
const oracle = await aeSdk.getOracleObject(oracleId)
const extendedOracle = await oracle.extendOracle(options)

// OR using the aeSdk (instance of AeSdk class) directly
const extendedOracle = await aeSdk.extendOracleTtl(options)
```

## Example applications

- [ae-oracle-pricefeed](https://github.com/aeternity/ae-oracle-pricefeed)
      - NodeJS example that registers an oracle, extends it if required and responds to queries automatically.
