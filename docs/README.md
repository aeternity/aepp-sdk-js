# Installation

## Direct `<script>` include via CDN

In case you're not using any JS bundling/compilation technique, the SDK can also be loaded with the traditional `<script>` tag, as follows:

### Latest SDK version

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@aeternity/aepp-sdk/dist/aepp-sdk.browser-script.cjs"></script>
```

### Specific SDK version

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@aeternity/aepp-sdk@VERSION/dist/aepp-sdk.browser-script.cjs"></script>
```

...where `VERSION` is the version number of the SDK you want to use (eg. `13.1.0`).

### Browser `<script>` tag

The bundle will assign the SDK to a global variable called `Aeternity` that makes all functionalities of the SDK accessible.

Usage:

```html
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- include latest SDK version -->
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/@aeternity/aepp-sdk/dist/aepp-sdk.browser-script.cjs"></script>
    <script type="text/javascript">
      const { AeSdk, Node } = Aeternity;

      const node = new Node('https://testnet.aeternity.io');
      const aeSdk = new AeSdk({
        nodes: [{ name: 'testnet', instance: node }],
      });
      aeSdk.getHeight().then((height) => {
        console.log('Current Block Height:' + height);
      });
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

## NPM

### Latest Release

```bash
npm i @aeternity/aepp-sdk
```

### Pre Release

To install a _Pre-Release_ (latest `beta` or `alpha` version) you have to install the package appending the `@next` tag reference.

```bash
npm i @aeternity/aepp-sdk@next
```

### Specific Github Branch

You can also install a version coming from a specific branch. In this case you would install the SDK version of the `develop` branch.

```bash
npm i github:aeternity/aepp-sdk-js#develop
```

### TypeScript projects

To work properly, sdk requires to enable `allowSyntheticDefaultImports` flag and register folder
that contains type definitions for third-party packages sdk depends on.
This may be done in `tsconfig.json`:

```diff
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    ...
+   "typeRoots": [
+     "node_modules/@types",
+     "node_modules/@aeternity/aepp-sdk/src/typings"
+   ],
+   "allowSyntheticDefaultImports": true
  }
}
```

SDK uses modern features available since typescript@4.7. Though SDK is still compatible with typescript@4.1 and above using types generated separately, but these types are less accurate.

Ensure that you have `strictFunctionTypes` option not enabled (as it is in VS code and `ts-node` by default), otherwise some of SDK types won't work correctly (see [#1793](https://github.com/aeternity/aepp-sdk-js/issues/1793)).

### Vue CLI@4

SDK checks are not working correctly because CLI picks both ESM and CJS versions of `autorest`
dependencies. To fix this, you need to specify aliases in `vue.config.js`.

```diff
module.exports = {
  configureWebpack: {
    resolve: {
      alias: {
+       '@azure/core-client': '@azure/core-client/dist-esm/src/index.js',
+       '@azure/core-rest-pipeline': '@azure/core-rest-pipeline/dist-esm/src/index.js',
      },
    },
  },
};
```

### Vue@3

Reactivity in Vue@3 [based on] Proxy class. Proxy is [not compatible] with private fields of ES
classes. AeSdk and Contract classes uses private fields, so if you make an instance of these
classes reactive then the app may fail with

> TypeError: attempted to get private field on non-instance

AeSdk and Contract classes doesnâ€™t have a state intended to be tracked using reactivity. Therefore
to solve this issue we suggest to avoid making their instances reactive. One of the ways is to use
Vue's integrated utility: [shallowRef]. The idea is to make reactive only the
root variable, to don't make it reactive in deep. You can find it implementation in the
[Ã¦pp example].

## Command Line Interface (CLI)

If you don't need to include specific functionality into your application and just want to use or play around with features the SDK provides you can make use of the [ðŸ’» CLI](https://github.com/aeternity/aepp-cli-js) and follow the instructions mentioned there.
