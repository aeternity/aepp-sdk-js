# Development

## Principles

The Javascript SDK wraps the æternity API explosed by
[Node's Swagger file]. It aims to abstract the API, while still providing
low-level access to it's endpoints, when necessary.

It uses the following Javascript technologies and principles:

- [JavaScript the Good Parts] (because Crockford is always right)
- [ES6 modules], using `export` and `import`
- [Promises] using ES7 [async/await] syntax, where applicable
- Functional Programming using [Ramda]
- Statelessness wherever possible
- [webpack 4] and the [Babel] [loader]
- Strictly enforced [StandardJS]
- Loose coupling of modules to enable [tree-shaking]
- Convention over configuration
- "Easy things should be easy, and hard things should be possible." [source] -- [Larry Wall]
- Support for
    - module access, enabling tree-shaking
    - direct use in node scripts through bundling
    - direct use in browser `<script>` tags through bundling
    - bundling through webpack

## Requirements

aepp-sdk is transpiled to EcmaScript 5 through [WebPack](https://webpack.js.org/), using [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) and is expected to work in any sufficiently new version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (`>= v12.17`) or modern web browser.

## Contributing

1. Clone the application
2. Make sure your editor/IDE can read and use the `.editorconfig` file
3. Start hacking (and dont forget to add [test](#testing) for whatever you'll be building).

## Documenting

Apart from documenting features and code, there is also documentation automatically generated using [**TypeDoc**](https://typedoc.org/) for documenting TS files and [a script](https://github.com/aeternity/aepp-sdk-js/blob/master/tooling/docs/examples-to-md.js) for documenting examples and code partials.

```bash
#generate examples and api documentation
npm run docs:examples && npm run docs:api
```

## Building

aepp-sdk is built using npm. In order to build a development version, launch the `build:dev` command.

```bash
npm install
npm run build:dev
```

## Testing

To test, launch the `test` command. This will run [mocha](https://mochajs.org/)'s tests locally.

```bash
npm test
```

This repository also includes a docker-compose file, to allow you to **run your own æternity node locally**. If you want to do so, **from the root of the project**:

1. Create a _**docker-compose.override.yml**_ file with this content:
```yaml
version: "3"
services:
  node:
    ports:
      - 3013:3013
      - 3113:3113
      - 3014:3014
      - 3001:3001
```
2. Run `docker-compose up node`
3. Congrats! you're now running your own æternity node locally.

The WebPack compilation provides two different build artifacts in `dist/`, one
for Node.js and one for browsers. When referencing aepp-sdk through any modern
build tooling, it should pick the right one automatically through the entry
points defined in `package.json`.

## Installation / Linking

In order to add a local development version of aepp-sdk to a project, `npm link`[1] can be used.
